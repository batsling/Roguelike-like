# Performance & streamlining backlog

Findings from a read-only efficiency pass over the whole codebase (2026-08-18).

**Fixed since, and out of this file:** the four measured *atlas* findings (see the
CHANGELOG entry "The star chart stopped doing the same work twice"); then the
star-chart double sweep, the uncached route DAG and the three dead functions
("Two hot paths that were doing the work twice"); then the overworld's full-page
`_refresh` ("The page stopped redrawing things that had not changed"); and then
the glyph shaping cost that one uncovered, by shipping the fonts ("The UI stopped
asking the host what a ⚔ looks like").

**One item is left**, below, and it has not been started. It states what is wrong,
why it is wrong, what the fix looks like, and how to know it worked.

**Two measurements worth keeping** from the passes that emptied the rest of this
file, both because they say something about where to look next:

*The quadratic loop that wasn't.* The `Array.has()` edge loop in
`RunGraph.shortest_path_dag` measured **flat** — A/B'd against the same route in
the same process it was 0.322 ms with `Array.has()` and 0.308 ms with a
`Dictionary` set per layer, which is noise. The layers of a real route are two or
three games wide, not the 15+ the degree curve suggested, so the linear scan was
never scanning anything. The set went in anyway (strictly better, measured no
worse) but the memo beside it was the entire win.

*Where the time in a rebuild actually went.* Not, as this file had assumed, in
the offering cards or the pack strip — those are ~1.5 ms and ~0.3 ms. It was in
**five small verb chips, at 10.9 ms**, because every Label carrying one of the
UI's symbol glyphs was making Godot search the host's fonts for it, uncached.
Both times the thing that looked expensive was cheap and something unremarkable
next to it was not. Measure first.

*And the fix for that was not where it looked either.* Declaring the shipped
subsets as theme fallbacks only took 15.4 ms to 12.4 — because the BASE font runs
its own system search on a miss, and runs it BEFORE the fallbacks. Turning that
off and putting a system font at the END of the chain got 4.5 ms with nothing
lost. Then the subsets' own vertical metrics grew every line in the game by 9px,
because Godot takes a font's height as the max over the whole chain; they are
rescaled onto the base font's exact em grid now, which `test_display_settings.gd`
checks at every size the UI uses. Three separate traps in one two-line change.

## 1. `Overworld2.gd` is 5309 lines

More than double the next-biggest file (`AtlasView.gd`, 2764). It currently holds
the run-loop view, the report checklist, the pinned header, the map plumbing, the
shop and machine mounting, the charge chips, the offering cards, and the
save/load view state.

**Not urgent, and not a mechanical job.** The obvious seams, roughly in order of
how cleanly they come out:

- **The header** (`_mount_header`, `_fit_page_under_header`, `_publish_header_strip`,
  `_build_health_chip`, `_build_gold_chip`, `_refresh_route_strip`, `HEADER_LAYER`)
  — self-contained, talks to the page only through `ModalScaffold.reserved_top`
  and the scroll's `offset_top`. ~250 lines.
- **The report checklist** (`_populate_play_panel`, `_verify_row`,
  `_add_bonus_rows`, `_add_event_goal_rows`, `_ticked_*`, `_reset_checklist_state`)
  — one input (the board's bodies plus the standing goals), one output (the ticked
  instances). ~400 lines.
- **The offering** (`_make_choice_card`, `_make_start_card`, `_render_choices`,
  `_render_start_choices`, `_show_preview`, `_hover_line`) — ~350 lines.

Each wants to keep going through the overworld's public verbs (`pick`,
`report`, `bash_choice`, …) rather than reaching into `GameLoop2`, which is what
makes the current tests keep working through the move.

## The dead-code scan

Three functions were found unreferenced and deleted (`GameLoop2._pull_from_stack`,
`Collection._item_rarity_color`, `Collection._all_enemies`). The scan that found
them is worth re-running after any large change — a private function whose name
appears exactly once in its own file and nowhere else in `scripts/` or `test/`.
It caught a fourth last time that a refactor had just orphaned. A heuristic, not
a proof: Godot's virtuals (`_ready`, `_draw`, …) fall out only because they also
appear in other files, and a name reached through `call()` would be a false
positive — so read what it prints before deleting. It is clean as of this
commit:

```bash
for f in $(git ls-files '*.gd' | grep -v addons/); do
  grep -oP '^func \K_\w+' "$f" | while read -r fn; do
    [ "$(grep -c "\b$fn\b" "$f")" -eq 1 ] \
      && ! grep -rqF "$fn" --include='*.gd' scripts test --exclude="$(basename "$f")" \
      && echo "$f: $fn"
  done
done
```

## How to measure any of this

`.claude/skills/verify/` is the recipe: a temporary `test/_verify_driver.gd` +
`.tscn`, run headless (or under `xvfb-run` if you need frames), printing
`Time.get_ticks_usec()` deltas. Delete both files before committing. The atlas
numbers in the CHANGELOG were taken that way — 10 passes over the whole sky,
divided out — and that is enough resolution for everything here.
